**Bug 4:**

*   **Title:** Generic Error "Something went wrong" When Changing Password on Edge
*   **Description:** Attempting to change an account password using the Microsoft Edge browser results in a non-specific error message "Something went wrong," providing no details about the cause of the failure.
*   **Steps to Reproduce:**
    1.  Open the application in the Microsoft Edge browser.
    2.  Navigate to the account settings or password change section.

*   **Expected vs Actual Behavior:**
